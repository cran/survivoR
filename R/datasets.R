#' }
#' @details This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all seasons of Survivor. While there are consistent
#' events across the seasons there are some unique events such as the 'mutiny' in Survivor: Cook Islands (season 13)
#' or the 'Outcasts' in Survivor: Pearl Islands (season 7). For maintaining a standard, whenever there has been a change
#' in tribe for the castaways it has been recorded as \code{swapped}. \code{swapped} is used as the
#' term since 'the tribe swap' is a typical recurring milestone in each season of Survivor. Subsequent changes are recorded with
#' a trailing digit e.g. \code{swapped2}. This includes absorbed tribes e.g. Stephanie was 'absorbed'
#' in Survivor: Palau (season 10) and when 3 tribes are
#' reduced to 2. These cases are still considered 'swapped' to indicate a change in tribe status.
#'
#' Some events result in a castaway attending tribal but not voting. These are recorded as
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{Win}}{The castaway won the fire challenge}
#'   \item{\code{Lose}}{The castaway lost the fire challenge}
#'   \item{\code{None}}{The castaway did not cast a vote. This may be due to a vote steal or some other means}
#'   \item{\code{Immune}}{The castaway did not vote but were immune from the vote}
#' }
#'
#' Where a castaway has \code{immunity == 'hidden'} this means that player is protected by a hidden immunity idol. It may not
#' necessarily mean they played the idol, the idol may have been played for them. While the nullified votes data is complete
#' the \code{immunity} data does not include those who had immunity but did not receive a vote. This is a TODO.
#'
#' In the case where the 'steal a vote' advantage was played, there is a second row for the castaway that stole the vote.
#' The castaway who had their vote stolen are is recorded as \code{None}.
#'
#' Many castaways have been medically evacuated, quit or left the game for some other reason. In these cases where no votes
#' were cast there is a skip in the \code{order} variable. Since no votes were cast there is nothing to record on this
#' data frame. The correct order in which castaways departed the island is recorded on \code{castaways}.
#'
#' In the case of a tie, \code{voted_out} is recorded as \code{tie} to indicate no one was voted off the island in that
#' instance. The re-vote is recorded with \code{vote_order = 2} to indicate this is the second round of voting. In
#' the case of a second tie \code{voted_out} is recorded as \code{tie2}. The third step is either a draw of rocks,
#' fire challenge or countback (in the early days of survivor). In these cases \code{vote} is recorded as the colour of the
#' rock drawn, result of the fire challenge or 'countback'.

#'   \item{\code{winning_tribe}}{Name of the winner tribe. \code{NA} during the merge}
#' }
#'
#' @details A nested tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The
#' winners and winning tribe of the challenge are found by expanding the `winners`
#' column. For individual immunity challenges the winning tribe is simply `NA`.
#'
#' Typically in the merge if a single person win a reward they are allowed to bring
#' others along with them. The first castaway in the expanded list is likely to be the
#' winner and the subsequent players those they brought along with them. Although,
#' not always. Occasionally in the merge the castaways are split into two teams for
#' the purpose of the reward, in which case all castaways win the reward rather than
#' a single person.
#'
#' The `day` field on this data set represents the day of the tribal council rather
#' than the day of the challenge. This is to more easily associate the reward challenge
#' with the immunity challenge and result of the tribal council. It also helps for
#' joining tables.
#'
#' Note the challenges table is the combined immunity and rewards tables which will
#' eventually be dropped in later releases.

#' @details Each season by day holds a complete list of castaways still in the game and
#' which tribe they are on. Moving through each day you can observe the changes in
#' the tribe. For example the first day (usual day 2) has all castaways mapped to their
#' original tribe. The next day has the same minus the castaway just voted out. This
#' is useful for observing the changes in tribe make either due to castaways being voted
#' off the island, tribe swaps or otherwise.
