\description{
A dataset containing details on the reward challenges for each season
}
\details{
This is a nested data frame since more than one person can win the reward.
The list of castaways include all those that participated in the reward rather than simply
the castaway that won the challenge. Many challenges in the merge are such that there is
one winner of the challenge and they can choose a set number of people to join them. Typically
the first person on the list is the person who won the challenge and other just participated
in the reward. In the case where castaways were split into teams for the challenge (post merge),
technically they all won.
