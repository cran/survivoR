survivoR is a collection of data sets detailing events across all 40
seasons of the US Survivor, including castaway information, vote
history, immunity and reward challenge winners and jury votes.

# Installation

# Dataset overview

## Season summary

A table containing summary details of each season of Survivor, including
the winner, runner ups and location. Note this is a nested data frame
given there may be 1 or 2 runner ups. The grain is maintained to 1 row
per season.

## Castaways

Season and demographic information about each castaway. Within a season
the data is ordered by the first voted out, to sole survivor indicated
by <code>order</code>. When demographic information is missing, it
likely means that the castaway re-entered the game at a later stage by
winning the opportunity to return. Also meaning the castaway will
feature in the data twice for the season. Castaways that have played in
multiple seasons will feature more than once with the age and location
representing that point in time.

``` r
castaways %>% 
  filter(season == 40)

```

## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all
seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at
which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual
immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity
idol. This details the key events for the season.

``` r
vh <- vote_history %>% 
  filter(
    season == 40,
    episode == 10
  ) 
vh
#> # A tibble: 11 x 12

#> # ... with 4 more variables: nullified <lgl>, voted_out <chr>, order <dbl>,
#> #   vote_order <dbl>
```

``` r
vh %>% 
  count(vote)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   vote       n
#>   <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Denise     2
#> 2 Immune     1
#> 3 None       1
#> 4 Sophie     2
#> 5 Tyson      5
```

Events in the game such as fire challenges, rock draws, steal-a-vote
advantages or countbacks in the early days often mean a vote wasnâ€™t
placed for an individual. Rather a challenge may be won, lost, no vote
cast but attended Tribal Council, etc. These events are recorded in the
<code>vote</code> field. I have included a function
<code>clean\_votes</code> for when only need the votes cast for
individuals. If the input data frame has the <code>vote</code> column it
can simply be piped.

``` r
vh %>% 
  clean_votes() %>% 
  count(vote)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   vote       n
#>   <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Denise     2
#> 2 Sophie     2
#> 3 Tyson      5
```

## Immunity

A nested tidy data frame of immunity challenge results. Each row is a
Tribal Council. There may be multiple people or tribes that win immunity
which can be determined by expanding the data set. There may be
duplicates for the rare event when there are multiple eliminations after
a single immunity challenged.

``` r
immunity %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  unnest(immunity)
#> # A tibble: 23 x 8
#>    season_name       season episode title           day immunity voted_out order
#>    <chr>              <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>    <chr>     <int>
#>  1 Survivor: Winner~     40       1 Greatest of ~     2 Dakal    Natalie       1

#> # ... with 13 more rows
```

## Rewards

A nested data frame of reward challenge results. Typically in the merge,
if a single person win a reward they are allowed to bring others along
with them. The first castaway in the expanded list is likely to be the
winner and the subsequent players those they brought along with them.
Although, not always. Occasionally in the merge the castaways are split
into two teams for the purpose of the reward, in which case all
castaways win the reward rather than a single person.

``` r
rewards %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  unnest(reward)
#> # A tibble: 29 x 5
#>    season_name              season episode title                          reward

```

## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however
having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it
easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

``` r
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
#> # A tibble: 48 x 5
#>    season_name              season castaway finalist  vote
#>    <chr>                     <dbl> <chr>    <chr>    <dbl>
#>  1 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Sarah    Michele      0
#>  2 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Sarah    Natalie      0
#>  3 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Sarah    Tony         1
#>  4 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Ben      Michele      0
#>  5 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Ben      Natalie      0
#>  6 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Ben      Tony         1
#>  7 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Denise   Michele      0
#>  8 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Denise   Natalie      0
#>  9 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Denise   Tony         1
#> 10 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Nick     Michele      0
#> # ... with 38 more rows
```

``` r
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  group_by(finalist) %>% 
  summarise(votes = sum(vote))
#> `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   finalist votes
#>   <chr>    <dbl>
#> 1 Michele      0
#> 2 Natalie      4
#> 3 Tony        12
```

## Viewers

A data frame containing the viewer information for every episode across
all sesasons. It also includes the rating and viewer share information
for viewers aged 18 to 49 years of age.

``` r

## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season,
including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other
data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add
tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions.

``` r
tribe_colours
#> # A tibble: 139 x 5
#> # Groups:   season, tribe [139]
#>    season_name                   season tribe    tribe_colour tribe_status

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions of the form
<code>scale\_fill\_survivor()</code> and
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes()</code> to add season and tribe colours to
ggplot. The <code>scale\_fill\_survivor()</code> scales uses a colour
palette extracted from the season logo and
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes()</code> scales uses the tribal colours of the
specified season as a colour palette.

All that is required for the â€˜survivorâ€™ palettes is the desired season
as input. If not season is provided it will default to season 40.

<img src='dev/images/season-40-logo.png' align="center"/>

``` r
castaways %>% 
  count(season, personality_type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, fill = personality_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_survivor(40) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src='dev/images/survivor-pal-example.png' align="center"/>

Below are the palettes for all seasons.

<img src='dev/images/palettes1.png' align="center"/>

<img src='dev/images/palettes2.png' align="center"/>

To use the tribe scales, simply input the season number desired to use
those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name,
this needs to be passed to the scale function as
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes(season, tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where
<code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour
aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for
example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will
simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers
line graph above.

``` r
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways %>%
  filter(
    season == ssn,
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")

        y = "Votes",

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the
rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite
right. Please log an issue and I will correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across
the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the
issues and Iâ€™ll see what I can do. Also, if youâ€™d like to contribute by
adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact
me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

# Showcase

Data viz projects to showcase the data sets. This looks at the number of
immunity idols won and votes received for each winner.

    each castaway.

    season.
