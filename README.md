## Castaways

This data set contains season and demographic information about each
castaway. It is structured to view their results for each season.
Castaways that have played in multiple seasons will feature more than
once with the age and location representing that point in time.
Castaways that re-entered the game will feature more than once in the
same season as they technically have more than one boot order
e.g. Natalie Anderson - Winners at War.

Each castaway has a unique `castaway_id` which links the individual
across all data sets and seasons. It also links to the following ID’s
found on the `vote_history`, `jury_votes` and `challenges` data sets.

-   `vote_id`
-   `voted_out_id`
-   `finalist_id`
-   `winner_id`

### Castaway details

A few castaways have changed their name from season to season or have
been referred to by a different name during the season e.g. Amber
Mariano; in season 8 Survivor All-Stars there was Rob C and Rob M. That
information has been retained here in the `castaways` data set.

`castaway_details` contains unique information for each castaway. It
takes the full name from their most current season and their most
verbose short name which is handy for labelling.

It also includes gender, date of birth, occupation, race and ethnicity
data. If no source was found to determine a castaways race and
ethnicity, the data is kept as missing rather than making an assumption.

## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all
seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at
which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual
immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity
idol. This details the key events for the season.

``` r
vh <- vote_history |>

#> #   vote_order <dbl>, castaway_id <dbl>, vote_id <dbl>, voted_out_id <dbl>
```

``` r
vh |> 
  count(vote)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   vote       n
#>   <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Denise     2
#> 2 Immune     1
#> 3 None       1
#> 4 Sophie     2
#> 5 Tyson      5
```

Events in the game such as fire challenges, rock draws, steal-a-vote
advantages or countbacks in the early days often mean a vote wasn’t
placed for an individual. Rather a challenge may be won, lost, no vote
cast but attended Tribal Council, etc. These events are recorded in the
<code>vote</code> field. I have included a function
<code>clean\_votes</code> for when only need the votes cast for
individuals. If the input data frame has the <code>vote</code> column it
can simply be piped.

``` r
vh |> 
  clean_votes() |> 
  count(vote)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   vote       n
#>   <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Denise     2
#> 2 Sophie     2
#> 3 Tyson      5
```

## Challenges

The `challenge_results` and `challenge_description` data sets supersede
the `challenges` data set.

### Challenge results

A nested tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The
winners and winning tribe of the challenge are found by expanding the
`winners` column. For individual immunity challenges the winning tribe
is simply `NA`.

``` r
challenge_results |> 
  filter(season == 40)
#> # A tibble: 25 x 10
#>    season_name  season episode   day episode_title challenge_name challenge_type
#>    <chr>         <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>         <chr>          <chr>         
#>  1 Survivor: W~     40       1     2 Greatest of ~ By Any Means ~ Reward and Im~
#>  2 Survivor: W~     40       1     3 Greatest of ~ Blue Lagoon B~ Immunity      
#>  3 Survivor: W~     40       2     6 It's Like a ~ Draggin' the ~ Reward and Im~
#>  4 Survivor: W~     40       3     9 Out for Blood Rise and Shine Reward and Im~
#>  5 Survivor: W~     40       4    11 I Like Reven~ Beyond the Wh~ Reward and Im~
#>  6 Survivor: W~     40       5    14 The Buddy Sy~ Sea Crates     Immunity      
#>  7 Survivor: W~     40       6    16 Quick on the~ Rice Race      Reward and Im~
#>  8 Survivor: W~     40       7    18 We're in the~ Dear Liza      Immunity      
#>  9 Survivor: W~     40       7    18 We're in the~ Losing Face    Reward        
#> 10 Survivor: W~     40       8    21 This is Wher~ Get a Grip     Immunity      
#> # ... with 15 more rows, and 3 more variables: outcome_type <chr>,
#> #   challenge_id <chr>, winners <list>
```

Typically in the merge if a single person win a reward they are allowed
to bring others along with them. This is identified by `outcome_status`
column. If it states `Chosen to particpate` it means they were chosen by
the winner to particpate in the reward.

The `day` field on this data set represents the day of the tribal
council rather than the day of the challenge. This is to more easily
associate the reward challenge with the immunity challenge and result of
the tribal council. It also helps for joining tables.

The `challenge_id` is the primary key for the `challenge_description`
data set. The `challange_id` will change as the data or descriptions
change.

### Challenge description

This data set contains descriptive binary fields for each challenge.
Challenges can go by different names but where possible recurring
challenges are kept consistent. While there are tweaks to the
challenges, where the main components of the challenge is consistent,
they share the same name.

The features of each challenge have been determined largely through
string searches of key words that describe the challenge. It may not
capture the full essence of the challenge but on the whole will provide
a good basis for analysis. Since the description is simply a short
paragraph or sentence it may not flag all appropriate features. If any
descriptive features need altering please let me know in the
[issues](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/issues).

Features:

-   `puzzle`: If the challenge contains a puzzle element.
-   `race`: If the challenge is a race between tribes, teams or
    individuals.
-   `precision`: If the challenge contains a precision element
    e.g. shooting an arrow, hitting a target, etc.
-   `endurance`: If the challenge is an endurance event e.g. last tribe,
    team, individual standing.
-   `strength`: If the challenge is largerly strength based
    e.g. Shoulder the Load.
-   `turn_based`: If the challenge is conducted in a series of rounds
    until a certain amount of points are scored or there is one player
    remaining.
-   `balance`: If the challenge contains a balancing element.
-   `food`: If the challenge contains a food element e.g. the food
    challenge, biting off chunks of meat.
-   `knowledge`: If the challenge contains a knowledge component e.g. Q
    and A about the location.
-   `memory`: If the challenge contains a memory element e.g. memorising
    a sequence of items.
-   `fire`: If the challenge contains an element of fire making /
    maintaining.
-   `water`: If the challenge is held, in part, in the water.

## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however
having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it
easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season,
including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other
data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add
tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions.

``` r
tribe_colours

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions of the form
<code>scale\_fill\_survivor()</code> and
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes()</code> to add season and tribe colours to
ggplot. The <code>scale\_fill\_survivor()</code> scales uses a colour
palette extracted from the season logo and
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes()</code> scales uses the tribal colours of the
specified season as a colour palette.

All that is required for the ‘survivor’ palettes is the desired season
as input. If not season is provided it will default to season 40.

<img src='dev/images/season-40-logo.png' align="center"/>

``` r
castaways |> 
  count(season, personality_type) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, fill = personality_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_survivor(40) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src='dev/images/survivor-pal-example.png' align="center"/>

Below are the palettes for all seasons.

<img src='dev/images/palettes1.png' align="center"/>

<img src='dev/images/palettes2.png' align="center"/>

To use the tribe scales, simply input the season number desired to use
those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name,
this needs to be passed to the scale function as
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes(season, tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where
<code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour
aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for
example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will
simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers
line graph above.

``` r
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways |>
  filter(
    season == ssn,
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")
  ) |>
  mutate(label = glue("{castaway} ({original_tribe})")) |>
  select(label, castaway)

jury_votes |>
  filter(season == ssn) |>
  left_join(
    castaways |>
      filter(season == ssn) |>
      select(castaway, original_tribe),
    by = "castaway"
  ) |>
  group_by(finalist, original_tribe) |>
  summarise(votes = sum(vote)) |>
  left_join(labels, by = c("finalist" = "castaway")) |>
  {
    ggplot(., aes(x = label, y = votes, fill = original_tribe)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
      scale_fill_tribes(ssn, tribe = .$original_tribe) +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(
        x = "Finalist (original tribe)",
        y = "Votes",
        fill = "Original\ntribe",
        title = "Votes received by each finalist"
      )
  }
```

<img src='dev/images/votes.png' align="center"/>

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the
rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite
right. Before logging an issue please install the git version to see if
it has already been corrected. If not, please log an issue and I will
correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across
the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the
issues and I’ll see what I can do. Also, if you’d like to contribute by
adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact
me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

# Showcase

Data viz projects to showcase the data sets. This looks at the number of
immunity idols won and votes received for each winner.
