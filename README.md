# Dataset overview

## Season summary

A table containing summary details of each season of Survivor, including
the winner, runner ups and location. Note this is a nested data frame
given there may be 1 or 2 runner ups. The grain is maintained to 1 row
per season.

## Castaways

Season and demographic information about each castaway. Within a season
the data is ordered by the first voted out, to sole survivor indicated
by <code>order</code>. When demographic information is missing, it
likely means that the castaway re-entered the game at a later stage by
winning the opportunity to return. Also meaning the castaway will
feature in the data twice for the season. Castaways that have played in
multiple seasons will feature more than once with the age and location
representing that point in time.

``` r
castaways %>% 
  filter(season == 40)

## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all
seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at
which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual
immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity
idol. This details the key events for the season.

``` r
vh <- vote_history %>% 
  filter(
    season == 40,
    episode == 10
  ) 
vh
#> # A tibble: 11 x 12

#> # ... with 4 more variables: nullified <lgl>, voted_out <chr>, order <dbl>,
#> #   vote_order <dbl>
```

``` r
vh %>% 
  count(vote)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   vote       n
#>   <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Denise     2
#> 2 Immune     1
#> 3 None       1
#> 4 Sophie     2
#> 5 Tyson      5
```

Events in the game such as fire challenges, rock draws, steal-a-vote
advantages or countbacks in the early days often mean a vote wasnâ€™t
placed for an individual. Rather a challenge may be won, lost, no vote
cast but attended Tribal Council, etc. These events are recorded in the
<code>vote</code> field. I have included a function
<code>clean\_votes</code> for when only need the votes cast for
individuals. If the input data frame has the <code>vote</code> column it
can simply be piped.

``` r
vh %>% 
  clean_votes() %>% 
  count(vote)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   vote       n
#>   <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Denise     2
#> 2 Sophie     2
#> 3 Tyson      5
```

## Challenges

A nested tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The
winners and winning tribe of the challenge are found by expanding the
`winners` column. For individual immunity challenges the winning tribe
is simply `NA`.

``` r
challenges %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
#> # A tibble: 28 x 7
#>    season_name      season episode title           day challenge_type winners   
#>    <chr>             <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>          <list>    
#>  1 Survivor: Winne~     40       1 Greatest of ~     2 reward         <tibble [~
#>  2 Survivor: Winne~     40       1 Greatest of ~     2 immunity       <tibble [~
#>  3 Survivor: Winne~     40       1 Greatest of ~     3 immunity       <tibble [~

#>  5 Survivor: Winne~     40       2 It's Like a ~     6 immunity       <tibble [~
#>  6 Survivor: Winne~     40       3 Out for Blood     9 reward         <tibble [~
#>  7 Survivor: Winne~     40       3 Out for Blood     9 immunity       <tibble [~
#>  8 Survivor: Winne~     40       4 I Like Reven~    11 reward         <tibble [~
#>  9 Survivor: Winne~     40       4 I Like Reven~    11 immunity       <tibble [~
#> 10 Survivor: Winne~     40       5 The Buddy Sy~    14 immunity       <tibble [~
#> # ... with 18 more rows
```

Typically in the merge if a single person win a reward they are allowed
to bring others along with them. The first castaway in the expanded list
is likely to be the winner and the subsequent players those they brought
along with them. Although, not always. Occasionally in the merge the
castaways are split into two teams for the purpose of the reward, in
which case all castaways win the reward rather than a single person.

The `day` field on this data set represents the day of the tribal
council rather than the day of the challenge. This is to more easily
associate the reward challenge with the immunity challenge and result of
the tribal council. It also helps for joining tables.

Note the challenges table is the combined immunity and rewards tables
which will eventually be dropped in later releases.

## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however
having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it
easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

``` r
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
#> # A tibble: 48 x 5
#>    season_name              season castaway finalist  vote
#>    <chr>                     <dbl> <chr>    <chr>    <dbl>
#>  1 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Sarah    Michele      0
#>  2 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Sarah    Natalie      0
#>  3 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Sarah    Tony         1
#>  4 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Ben      Michele      0
#>  5 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Ben      Natalie      0
#>  6 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Ben      Tony         1
#>  7 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Denise   Michele      0
#>  8 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Denise   Natalie      0
#>  9 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Denise   Tony         1
#> 10 Survivor: Winners at War     40 Nick     Michele      0
#> # ... with 38 more rows
```

``` r
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  group_by(finalist) %>% 
  summarise(votes = sum(vote))
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   finalist votes
#>   <chr>    <dbl>
#> 1 Michele      0
#> 2 Natalie      4
#> 3 Tony        12
```

## Hidden Idols

A dataset containing the history of hidden immunity idols including who
found them, on what day and which day they were played. The idol number
increments for each idol the castaway finds during the game.

``` r
hidden_idols %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 9
#>    season_name  season castaway idol_number idols_held votes_nullified day_found

```

## Viewers

A data frame containing the viewer information for every episode across
all seasons. It also includes the rating and viewer share information
for viewers aged 18 to 49 years of age.

``` r

## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season,
including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other
data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add
tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions.

``` r
tribe_colours
#> # A tibble: 139 x 5

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions of the form
<code>scale\_fill\_survivor()</code> and
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes()</code> to add season and tribe colours to
ggplot. The <code>scale\_fill\_survivor()</code> scales uses a colour
palette extracted from the season logo and
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes()</code> scales uses the tribal colours of the
specified season as a colour palette.

All that is required for the â€˜survivorâ€™ palettes is the desired season
as input. If not season is provided it will default to season 40.

<img src='dev/images/season-40-logo.png' align="center"/>

``` r
castaways %>% 
  count(season, personality_type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, fill = personality_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_survivor(40) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src='dev/images/survivor-pal-example.png' align="center"/>

Below are the palettes for all seasons.

<img src='dev/images/palettes1.png' align="center"/>

<img src='dev/images/palettes2.png' align="center"/>

To use the tribe scales, simply input the season number desired to use
those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name,
this needs to be passed to the scale function as
<code>scale\_fill\_tribes(season, tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where
<code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour
aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for
example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will
simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers
line graph above.

``` r
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways %>%
  filter(
    season == ssn,
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")
  ) %>%
  mutate(label = glue("{castaway} ({original_tribe})")) %>%
  select(label, castaway)

jury_votes %>%
  filter(season == ssn) %>%
  left_join(
    castaways %>%
      filter(season == ssn) %>%
      select(castaway, original_tribe),
    by = "castaway"
  ) %>%
  group_by(finalist, original_tribe) %>%
  summarise(votes = sum(vote)) %>%
  left_join(labels, by = c("finalist" = "castaway")) %>%
  {
    ggplot(., aes(x = label, y = votes, fill = original_tribe)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
      scale_fill_tribes(ssn, tribe = .$original_tribe) +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(
        x = "Finalist (original tribe)",
        y = "Votes",
        fill = "Original\ntribe",
        title = "Votes received by each finalist"
      )
  }
```

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the
rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite
right. Please log an issue and I will correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across
the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the
issues and Iâ€™ll see what I can do. Also, if youâ€™d like to contribute by
adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact
me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

# Showcase

Data viz projects to showcase the data sets. This looks at the number of
immunity idols won and votes received for each winner.

# Contributors

A big thank you to:

-   **Camilla Bendetti** for collating the personality type data for
    each castaway.
-   **Uygar Sozer** for adding the filming start and end dates for each
    season.
-   **Holt Skinner** for creating the castaway ID to map people across
    seasons and manage name changes.
