## Castaways

This data set contains season and demographic information about each
castaway. It is structured to view their results for each season.
Castaways that have played in multiple seasons will feature more than
once with the age and location representing that point in time.
Castaways that re-entered the game will feature more than once in the
same season as they technically have more than one boot order
e.g. Natalie Anderson - Winners at War.

Each castaway has a unique `castaway_id` which links the individual
across all data sets and seasons. It also links to the following ID’s
found on the `vote_history`, `jury_votes` and `challenges` data sets.

-   `vote_id`
-   `voted_out_id`
-   `finalist_id`

### Castaway details

A few castaways have changed their name from season to season or have
been referred to by a different name during the season e.g. Amber
Mariano; in season 8 Survivor All-Stars there was Rob C and Rob M. That
information has been retained here in the `castaways` data set.

`castaway_details` contains unique information for each castaway. It
takes the full name from their most current season and their most
verbose short name which is handy for labelling.

It also includes gender, date of birth, occupation, race and ethnicity
data. If no source was found to determine a castaways race and
ethnicity, the data is kept as missing rather than making an assumption.

## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all
seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at
which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual
immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity
idol. This details the key events for the season.

## Challenges

Note: From v1.1 the `challenge_results` dataset has been improved but
could break existing code. The old table is maintained at
`challenge_results_dep`

There are two tables `challenge_results` and `challenge_description`.

### Challenge results

A tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The winners
and losers of the challenges are found recorded here.

``` r

  filter(season == 42) |> 
  group_by(castaway) |> 
  summarise(
    won = sum(result == "Won"),
    Lost = sum(result == "Lost"),
    total_challenges = n(),
    chose_for_reward = sum(chosen_for_reward)
  )

```

The `challenge_id` is the primary key for the `challenge_description`
data set. The `challange_id` will change as the data or descriptions
change.

TODO: Each challenge must have an ID and link to challenge description

### Challenge description

This data set contains descriptive binary fields for each challenge.
Challenges can go by different names but where possible recurring
challenges are kept consistent. While there are tweaks to the
challenges, where the main components of the challenge is consistent,
they share the same name.

The features of each challenge have been determined largely through
string searches of key words that describe the challenge. It may not
capture the full essence of the challenge but on the whole will provide
a good basis for analysis. Since the description is simply a short
paragraph or sentence it may not flag all appropriate features. If any
descriptive features need altering please let me know in the
[issues](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/issues).

Features:

-   `puzzle`: If the challenge contains a puzzle element.
-   `race`: If the challenge is a race between tribes, teams or
    individuals.
-   `precision`: If the challenge contains a precision element
    e.g. shooting an arrow, hitting a target, etc.
-   `endurance`: If the challenge is an endurance event e.g. last tribe,
    team, individual standing.
-   `strength`: If the challenge is largerly strength based
    e.g. Shoulder the Load.
-   `turn_based`: If the challenge is conducted in a series of rounds
    until a certain amount of points are scored or there is one player
    remaining.
-   `balance`: If the challenge contains a balancing element.
-   `food`: If the challenge contains a food element e.g. the food
    challenge, biting off chunks of meat.
-   `knowledge`: If the challenge contains a knowledge component e.g. Q
    and A about the location.
-   `memory`: If the challenge contains a memory element e.g. memorising
    a sequence of items.
-   `fire`: If the challenge contains an element of fire making /
    maintaining.
-   `water`: If the challenge is held, in part, in the water.

## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however
having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it
easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

## Advantages

### Advantage Details

This dataset lists the hidden idols and advantages in the game for all
seasons. It details where it was found, if there was a clue to the
advantage, location and other advantage conditions. This maps to the
`advantage_movement` table.

```

### Advantage Movement

The `advantage_movement` table tracks who found the advantage, who they
may have handed it to and who the played it for. Each step is called an
event. The `sequence_id` tracks the logical step of the advantage. For
example in season 41, JD found an Extra Vote advantage. JD gave it to
Shan in good faith who then voted him out keeping the Extra Vote. Shan
gave it to Ricard in good faith who eventually gave it back before Shan
played it for Naseer. That movement is recorded in this table.

## Confessionals

A dataset containing the number of confessionals for each castaway by
season and episode. The data has been counted by contributors of the
survivoR R package and consolidated with external sources. The aim is to
establish consistency in confessional counts in the absence of official
sources. Given the subjective nature of the counts and the potential for
clerical error no single source is more valid than another. Therefore,
it is reasonable to average across all sources.

``` r
confessionals |> 
  filter(season == 42) |> 
  group_by(castaway) |> 
  summarise(n_confessionals = sum(confessional_count))
#> # A tibble: 18 × 2
#>    castaway n_confessionals

```

## Screen time \[EXPERIMENTAL\]

This dataset contains the estimated screen time for each castaway during
an episode. Please note that this is still in the early days of
development. There is likely to be misclassifcation and other sources of
error. The model will be refined over time.

An individuals’ screen time is calculated, at a high-level, via the
following process:

1.  Frames are sampled from episodes on a 1 second time interval

2.  MTCNN detects the human faces within each frame

3.  VGGFace2 converts each detected face into a 512d vector space

4.  A training set of labelled images (1 for each contestant + 3 for
    Jeff Probst) is processed in the same way to determine where they
    sit in the vector space. TODO: This could be made more accurate by
    increasing the number of training images per contestant.

5.  The Euclidean distance is calculated for the faces detected in the
    frame to each of the contestants in the season (+Jeff). If the
    minimum distance is greater than 1.2 the face is labelled as
    “unknown”. TODO: Review how robust this distance cutoff truly is -
    currently based on manual review of Season 42.

6.  A multi-class SVM is trained on the training set to label faces. For
    any face not identified as “unknown”, the vector embedding is run
    into this model and a label is generated.

7.  All labelled faces are aggregated together, with an assumption of
    1-5 full second of screen time each time a face is seen and
    factoring in time between detection capping at a max of 5 seconds.

```

Currently it only includes data for season 42. More seasons will be
added as they are completed.

## Tribe mapping

A mapping for castaways to tribes for each day (day being the day of the
tribal council). This is useful for observing who is on what tribe
throughout the game. Each season by day holds a complete list of
castaways still in the game and which tribe they are on. Moving through
each day you can observe the changes in the tribe. For example the first
day (usual day 2) has all castaways mapped to their original tribe. The
next day has the same minus the castaway just voted out. This is useful
for observing the changes in tribe make either due to castaways being
voted off the island, tribe swaps, who is on Redemption Island and Edge
of Extinction.

## Boot Mapping

A mapping table for easily filtering to the set of castaways that are
still in the game after a specified number of boots. How this differs
from the tribe mapping is that rather than being focused on an episode,
it is focused on the boot which is often more useful. This is useful for
filtering to who is still alive in the game for a given episode and
number of boots. When someone quits the game or is medically evacuated
it is considered a boot. This table tracks multiple boots per episode.

``` r
# filter to season 42 and when there are 6 people left
# 18 people in the season, therefore 12 boots

still_alive <- function(.version, .season, .n_boots) {
  survivoR::boot_mapping |>
    filter(
      version == .version,
      season == .season,
      order == .n_boots,
      game_status %in% c("In the game", "Returned")
    )
}

## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season,
including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other
data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add
tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions.

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions of the form
<code>scale_fill_survivor()</code> and <code>scale_fill_tribes()</code>
to add season and tribe colours to ggplot. The
<code>scale_fill_survivor()</code> scales uses a colour palette
extracted from the season logo and <code>scale_fill_tribes()</code>
scales uses the tribal colours of the specified season as a colour
palette.

All that is required for the ‘survivor’ palettes is the desired season
as input. If not season is provided it will default to season 40.

``` r
castaways |> 
  distinct(season, castaway_id) |> 
  left_join(
    castaway_details |> 
      select(castaway_id, personality_type),
    by = "castaway_id"
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, fill = personality_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_survivor(40) +
  theme_minimal()

Below are the palettes for all seasons.

To use the tribe scales, simply input the season number desired to use
those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name,
this needs to be passed to the scale function as
<code>scale_fill_tribes(season, tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where
<code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour
aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for
example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will
simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers
line graph above.

``` r
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways |>
  filter(
    season == ssn,
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")
  ) |>
  mutate(label = glue("{castaway} ({original_tribe})")) |>
  select(label, castaway)

jury_votes |>
  filter(season == ssn) |>
  left_join(
    castaways |>
      filter(season == ssn) |>
      select(castaway, original_tribe),
    by = "castaway"
  ) |>
  group_by(finalist, original_tribe) |>
  summarise(votes = sum(vote)) |>
  left_join(labels, by = c("finalist" = "castaway")) |>
  {
    ggplot(., aes(x = label, y = votes, fill = original_tribe)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
      scale_fill_tribes(ssn, tribe = .$original_tribe) +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(
        x = "Finalist (original tribe)",
        y = "Votes",
        fill = "Original\ntribe",
        title = "Votes received by each finalist"
      )
  }
```

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the
rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite
right. Before logging an issue please install the git version to see if
it has already been corrected. If not, please log an issue and I will
correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across
the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the
issues and I’ll see what I can do. Also, if you’d like to contribute by
adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact
me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

# Showcase

## Survivor Dashboard

[**Carly Levitz**](https://twitter.com/carlylevitz) has developed a
fantastic
[dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carly.levitz/viz/SurvivorCBSData-Acknowledgements/Acknowledgements)
showcasing the data and allowing you to drill down into seasons,
castaways, voting history and challenges.

## Data viz

This looks at the number of immunity idols won and votes received for
each winner.
